## The Egypt Death Penalty Index

The Egypt Death Penalty Index is a project that I designed and executed while working for the British human rights organization [Reprieve](https://reprieve.org/uk/). Since the ascension to power of current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in early July 2013, Egyptian courts have handed down thousands of preliminary death sentences. (In criminal court proceedings in Egypt, a court must first "recommend" a death sentence, and then decide whether to "confirm" that sentence following a period of consideration). With Reprieve, I investigated the cases of individuals facing unlawful execution in Egypt; I worked primarily on behalf of peaceful protestors and children sentenced to death in patently unfair trials.

In the course of my work on individual cases, it became problematic that there did not exist anywhere in the world a single, codified database tracking all of those on Egypt's death row. It was understandable why that resource didn't exist--it would need to include detailed information about thousands of individuals, and building it would require considerable resources. That sounded like a challenge we could meet, so I set out to build it. With funding from the German Federal Foreign Office, I spent more than a year working with a team of researchers and lawyers based in both London and Cairo. We fanned out across Egypt, collected and digitized paper court judgments, conducted interviews with victims and their family members, and built the world's first comprehensive database tracking Egypt's massive, unlawful application of the death penalty: the [Egypt Death Penalty Index](https://egyptdeathpenaltyindex.com).

### Data Collection and Verification

Collecting data for this project was complex. We documented death sentences through a combination of original court documents, media reports, contact with releveant lawyers, and information provided by leading Egyptian human rights organizations. We needed to balance comprehensiveness--we wanted to document every single death sentence--with accuracy. To achieve that, we made every effort to cross-verify all data points with at least two kinds of sources, and each row of data includes a column indicating which types of sources were used to verify it.


### Data Organization and Analysis
This entire project was completed in Excel. By the time I undertook this project, I had become quite proficient in using Excel to organize data and perform statistical analysis, but I had yet to learn how to use R or Python. I chose to include the Index in this portfolio partly because it is a strong example of the type of data-centric approach that is sorely needed in the human rights investigations field, but also because this is the project that most inspired me to go back to school to learn R and Python in order to take on more complex data-driven human rights investigations.
