## The Egypt Death Penalty Index

The Egypt Death Penalty Index is a project that I designed and executed while working for the British human rights organization [Reprieve](https://reprieve.org/uk/). Since the ascension to power of current President Abdel Fattah el-Sisi in early July 2013, Egyptian courts have handed down thousands of preliminary death sentences. (In criminal court proceedings in Egypt, a court must first "recommend" a death sentence, and then decide whether to "confirm" that sentence following a period of consideration). With Reprieve, I investigated the cases of individuals facing unlawful execution in Egypt; I worked primarily on behalf of peaceful protestors and children sentenced to death in patently unfair trials.


In the course of my work on individual cases, it became problematic that there did not exist anywhere in the world a single, codified database tracking all of those on Egypt's death row. It was understandable why that resource didn't exist--it would need to include detailed information about thousands of individuals, and building it would require considerable resources. That sounded like a challenge we could meet, so I set out to build it. With funding from the German Federal Foreign Office, I spent more than a year assembling and managing a team of researchers and lawyers based in both London and Cairo. We fanned out across Egypt, collected and digitized paper court judgments, conducted interviews with victims and their family members, and built the world's first comprehensive database tracking Egypt's massive, unlawful application of the death penalty: the [Egypt Death Penalty Index](https://egyptdeathpenaltyindex.com).

### Methodology

**Data collection and verification**: Data for this project was collected through a variety of sources. As above, wherever possible we relied on original court documents, as these provide the most reliable information about death sentences. That said, there are hundreds of trials represented in the Index, and court documents were not available for all of them. Where we could not locate court documents, we relied on media reports (especially those that directly quoted court archives), contact with relevant lawyers, and information provided by leading Egyptian human rights organizations. We made every effort to cross-verify all data points with at least two kinds of sources, and each row of data includes a column indicating which types of sources were used to verify it.

**Data analysis**: This entire project was completed in Excel.


### Data set

From there, we need to find a way to filter the larger set of search results whose headlines contain the word "حكم" into a smaller subset that contains exclusively execution announcements. I chose the word "تنفيذ" itself, as that seems to be present only in execution announcement headlines.
